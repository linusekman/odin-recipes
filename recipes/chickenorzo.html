    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken and orzo bake is a tasty one-pot dinner, suitable for weeknights. The spinach and sun-dried tomatoes add a nice pop of color and loads of flavor to the cheesy orzo.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 skinless boneless chicken thighs (1 1/2 pounds)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pound dry orzo</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (5 ounce) package baby spinach</li>
        <li>4 ounces Parmesan cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped (not oil-packed)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 5- to 6-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add half the chicken thighs. Cook until seared and lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes each side. Transfer browned chicken to a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to Dutch oven. Add onions. Cook until tender and lightly browned, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in minced garlic, cooking until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add butter to Dutch oven. Once melted, add orzo, quickly stirring until fully coated with butter. Carefully pour in chicken broth. Scrape bottom of Dutch oven with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until orzo has absorbed most of the liquid, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove Dutch oven from oven. Stir in spinach, Parmesan, dried tomatoes, lemon zest, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Nestle chicken thighs into orzo mixture. Cover, return to the oven, and bake until chicken is no longer pink at the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
